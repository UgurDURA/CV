       <td><strong>De Novo Protein Prediction Based on Neural Network</strong> </strong> <br> <strong><em>Senior Project</em></strong> <br>This project aim is providing the user with a new enzyme that performs the "combined"
      catalytic activity that the user desired. What planned is processing the data which is taken
      from several databases to examine the nature of the active site and amino acids that
      catalyze the certain enzymatic reaction with the help of the neural network. The system will
      be trained with active site polarity matrices when user wants to combine two different
      enzyme activity onto one compound, the software will predict a possible active site polarity.
      This possible polarity matrix will be searched on a carefully designed database to find the
      best possible amino acid sequence to synthesize this unique enzyme.</td>

    <br> <a href="https://github.com/Twodor/BrightBornProject">BrightBorn</a></strong> <br> <strong><em>Do You Wanna Learn Possible Disease On Your Child?</em></strong> <br> BrightBorn offers to predict possible offsprings of the users with taking their genome
    sequence. Since it is a long process to find treatment for genetic diseases. I created this
    project to inform parents about their possible mutation to prevent complications that could
    occur in the child in future. Parents can decide depending on this health report whether or
    not to bear the child. To do that I combined software tools and genetical knowledge to
    create a technique to find the possibility of these genetical diseases. <br>
